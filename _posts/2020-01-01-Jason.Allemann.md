## Bio


Jason loves the challenge and creativity involved in designing his own models, and bringing them to life using the LEGO robotics systems. It allows him to combine his love of mechanics and software development to create complex and imaginative machines.

Discovering the first LEGO MINDSTORMS system in 1999 was a big reason he started building with LEGO again as an adult. Since then, he has developed a passion for designed his own models and sharing them with others. He has displayed his models at many events around the world, and often shares instructions so others can learn from and enjoy
