## Bio

Lee uses his bricks as a means of honest self expression. His passion for LEGO, mechanics and more importantly, creating things, extends not only to the fantastic builds but also to his professional work. From giant dragons, to wearable dresses and even small little sumo bots, he reminds his audience that anything he makes is just a part of him.
