## Bio


Marc-André, who holds a bachelor’s degree in education, taught computer science and history for 8 years, while developing his passion for video production and social media. His Youtube videos of LEGO® stop-motion were viewed by more than 30 million people. He is also the founder of Ciné Brique, the first “brickfilms” festival in Canada and the biggest LEGO® creation exposition in Quebec. Marc-André was able to connect his two biggest passions, education and technology, when he discovered educational robotics. Since then, Marc-André explores the avenues of “hands on the keyboard” teaching and shares his passion with students and teachers in Canada.
