## Bio


Will is a 25 year-old architect and lifelong LEGO enthusiast. As a child, he even participated on a FIRST LEGO League team. A few years ago, he reignited his interest in LEGO. 

What interests him most is to present topics such as robotics in an accessible way. To show people simple and practical examples of robotics, he started to make robotic arms using MINDSTORMS. His goal is to inspire others to learn the mechanism, tinker, modify, and ultimately create their own models. Most recently, Will participated in the Alexa MINDSTORMS contest, creating an elaborate Battleship game.
