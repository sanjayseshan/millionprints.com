## Bio

Since he received his first space-themed LEGO sets in the 1980s, Ben has always sought out ways to motorize his own LEGO creations. So when Handyboard, and the RCX came out, his dream came true!!! Since 2015, Ben has been involved in FIRST LEGO League, initially coaching one team. Since 2017, he has been coaching two teams, to promote STEM and Coopertition, and trial-based based design. His approach to learning is hands-on and enabling students to learn fun and useful concepts and focus on the process. Among other projects, he is working on a swarm of "ants", an EV3 version of the emotionally driven robot PHOBOT, and a TETRIX megazorg.
