## Bio


Hans Peter rediscovered his love of LEGO through his four sons and quickly discovered LEGO MINDSTORMS was for him. He considers it his hobby and a passion and finds it fun to show people the endless possibilities of MINDSTORMS by building all the models he can get his hands on! Hans got noticed by the community after systematically rebuilding every single #robotremix that has been published on [The NXT Step (is EV3)](http://www.thenxtstep.com/?q=robot+remix)(TNS) blog. In 2017, he joined the ranks MINDSTORMS Community Partners (MCP) for these efforts. In February 2018, Hans Peter got invited to exhibit his own MINDSTORMS robot at the LEGO World, Copenhagen.
