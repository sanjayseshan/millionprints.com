## Bio


Hello World!

I design playful experiences for children to creatively express themselves using all kinds of technology. For over fifteen years I have been developing creative content and community engagement experiences in the realm of construction and coding for the LEGO Company. I am a leader in the Maker Education movement, and design maker spaces, curriculum, and professional development for teachers. I believe that every child can design, engineer, code and bring their imaginative ideas to life. I have a passion for social-emotional and playful learning, and thoughtfully follow a developmental lens in my design process. 

I am a DEVELOPMENTAL INNOVATOR. I apply the design process, research, and pedagogy that suits the needs of the project. I use insights to uncover new ideas and directions.

I am an EXPERIENCE DESIGNER. I use an empathetic, human-centered, social-emotional and developmental approach in my creative process.

I am a CREATIVE, an ARTIST and a MAKER. I embrace the creative process. I give time for ideas to simmer to make room for eureka moments. I visualize ideas through physical models, and creatively communicate through my writerâ€™s craft. My home workshop is a funhouse of materials and technology to tinker and experiment with. Come over and play!

I am an EARLY ADOPTER and VISIONARY. I explore emerging trends and synthesize their metaphors to create visions for new forms of play and social interaction.

I am a STORYTELLER. My creative work is authentic, connected, and rooted in context.
