## Bio

John Hansen took over the popular RCX Command Center IDE from its original creator, Mark Overmars, in 2001 and over time extended and renamed it as the Bricx Command Center (BricxCC) IDE for LEGO MINDSTORMS with support for nearly all the LEGO programmable bricks. Eventually, he was asked to take over the Not Quite C (NQC) project by its original creator Dave Baum and released several updates with enhanced functionality and bug fixes over the years.

John was invited to join the MINDSTORMS Users Panel (MUP) in November 2005 when it was expanded from 5 to 14 members. While serving on the MUP, the subsequent MINDSTORMS Developers Program (MDP), and the MINDSTORMS Community Panel (MCP) John developed the NeXT Byte Codes assembly language and the NBC compiler for the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT. This was followed shortly by the creation of the Not eXactly C (NXC) programming language for the NXT.

Robotics enthusiasts around the world use the BricxCC IDE to program multiple generations of LEGO MINDSTORMS robots in NQC, LEGO Mindscript, Java, C, C++, Forth, NBC, and NXC. John is also the author of LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Power Programming - Robotics in C.
